#The Coursework Theme
> *The theme of the coursework is to use the Engduino as a device to collect data that can be uploaded to a computer and
displayed using a table or graph, or some other interesting way to display the data.*

# My approach to the coursework:
## Engduino Copter

A 2D endless side-scrolling helicopter game where the user moves a helicopter on the screen using an engduino-arduino controller. The objective of the game is to avoid crashing into the walls or the boundaries of the screen. This game was inspired by FlappyBirds.

#How it works

C program reads acceleration sensor data from the Engduino-arduino microcontroller through the USB Serial Port.
Processing program reads acceleration data from the C program and responds by altering the position of the helicopter.

#Controls

Connect the Engduino to a USB extension cable and then to the computer USB port.
Simply hold the Engduino flat towards the ground and tilt it upwards/downwards to move the helicopter.
